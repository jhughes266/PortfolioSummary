# Jotham Hughes – Engineering & Deep Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. This repository serves as the entry point for exploring a selection of technical projects I've built across my studies, placements and in my own time. The focus is on deep learning, mathematical rigor, and practical engineering.

Whether you're an employer, collaborator, or fellow learner, this hub is intended to give a clear view of my skillset, working style, and technical depth.

## What You'll Find Here

The portfolio is divided into two themes:

### Deep Learning – Educational Projects

These repositories contain neural networks and deep learning systems built entirely from scratch using NumPy — no high-level ML frameworks. Every layer, optimizer, and training loop has been hand-coded, with extensive testing and visualizations to aid learning.

| Project | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| [Batch Normalization Network](https://github.com/jhughes266/BatchNormilization) | Explores how batch normalization affects learning. Contrasts performance with and without normalization. |
| [CNN from Scratch](https://github.com/jhughes266/CNN) | Full convolutional architecture with pooling and manual backprop, trained on MNIST. |
| [Dropout Network](https://github.com/jhughes266/Dropout) | Implements dropout and compares its generalization impact on synthetic and real datasets. |
| [GAN for MNIST Digits](https://github.com/jhughes266/GAN) | Trains a GAN to generate the digit "6" using custom dense layers and alternating training loops. |
| [Optimizer Comparison](https://github.com/jhughes266/Optimizers) | Benchmarks SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, AdaGrad, and Adam using identical network topologies. |
| [Regularization (L1 vs L2)](https://github.com/jhughes266/Regularization) | Visualizes weight matrices to demonstrate how L1 and L2 shape model learning. |
| [RNN & LSTM Experiments](https://github.com/jhughes266/RNN-LSTM) | Walks through the building blocks of recurrent architectures, trained on time-based synthetic tasks. |
| [Fully Connected Net](https://github.com/jhughes266/FullyConnected) | Builds a two-layer network and applies full backprop with TensorFlow-assisted MNIST loading. |
| [Transformer in Excel](https://github.com/jhughes266/Transformer-Excel) | Highly detailed numerical breakdown of a 2-layer transformer implemented in Microsoft Excel. Focuses on teaching the forward/backward pass and parameter updates visually. |

### Placement 

These projects were developed through my research placement at Swinburne University — designed to be deployed in real-world settings.

| Project | Summary                                                                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pose Estimation and Calibration](https://github.com/jhughes266/PersonTracker) | Real-time body tracking with MediaPipe and OpenCV. Outputs velocity, angle, quadrant, and position using only a webcam. |
| [Template Tracker with Serial Output](https://github.com/jhughes266/TemplateTracker) | Tracks physical templates via webcam and streams positional data over a serial interface. Supports thresholding.        |

## Skills Demonstrated

Across these projects, I’ve built a hands-on understanding of:

- Forward and backward propagation in a variety of neural networks  
- Training logic including dropout, batch normalization, and regularization  
- Optimizer design and comparative benchmarking  
- Temporal models (RNN/LSTM) and attention mechanisms  
- Object tracking, calibration, and pose estimation  
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and debugging  
- Clean modular design and structured testing (via spreadsheets, graphs, or unit scripts)

These projects reflect a commitment to understanding how things work at the lowest level, before reaching for abstraction.
